I'm going to have a setup component at the top that displays what the starting date, display date and increments are.
Down below, there will be three windows displaying the values for the day before, the display date and the next date. 
There will be arrows to move to the next and previous day.

There may be issues if both dates match. I should be careful about that.


I'll possibly add a tracker of progress between different days.
